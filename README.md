# Election Analysis
An analysis of election data using Python. 

## Overview of Election Audit:
We are working with Tom and Seth from the Colorado Board on elections, to preform an audit on the upcoming election. We are using Python, Gitbash, and Visual Studio Code to preform our analysis.

#### The below pseudocode provided us an outline for the analysis: 

1. The data we need to retrieve.
2. The total number of votes cast
3. A complete list of candidates who received votes
4. the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. the total number of votes each candidate won 
6. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election-Audit Summary:

After working with the commission to calculate the analysis of the election, we could determine that there were a total of 369,711 votes. Now, out of that data we can see that the largest amount of votes was in Denver at 82.8%. Breaking it down further, we looked at the three candidates within those counties of Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. 
Diana DeGette won the election by a 73.8% margin over her competitors. 

### Additional Places for analysis:
1. When loading a file you can use an direct path to the file rather than the indirect used in the file. For Example you could write:

##### ![alt text](https://github.com/mbehr11/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/direct_path_to_file.PNG) #####

***file_to_load ='(Folder)'/'(file in folder)'.csv'***
2. You could create an if statement after the county percentage to order the counties list automatically.
